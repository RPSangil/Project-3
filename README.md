## Introduction

At the UN Glasgow climate conference, a new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit.[<sup>1</sup>](#reference-list) This agreement will set the tone for the global agenda on climate change for the next decade and Australia has modified their previous target that included net zero emissions by 2050 to achieve up to 35 per cent reduction by 2030.[<sup>2</sup>](#reference-list)

With the up coming legislation changes that will enforce companies to conduct business in a carbon neutral way, a whole new industry has begun to bloom. This industry utilizes carbon capture technology to provides carbon offsetting as a service to other companies. A new form of fungible token has emerged, Carbon Credits.[<sup>3</sup>](#reference-list)

## Our Goal

A Government Organisation has approached 3 Squared for a product solution regarding upcoming developments of the Carbon Neutral Agreement made at COP26.

This project aims to:

1. Produce a smart contract in which Carbon Credits are minted by the Government Organisation only. 
2. Produce a smart contract that facilitates a Carbon Capture Company to purchase Carbon Credits from the government for declaration of carbon.
3. Produce a smart contract that facilitates the purchase of Carbon Credits for funds.
4. Produce a smart contract that facilitates company board members to vote on where a Carbon Credit transaction shold be approved or not.
